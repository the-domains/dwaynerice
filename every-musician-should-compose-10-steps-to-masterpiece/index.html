<h1>Every musician should compose. 10 Steps to masterpiece.</h1><p>Music composition is to music what story writing is to literature, or painting is to art.  It is the sharing of a story or idea, no matter how abstract, between composer, performers, and audience.</p><p>Creating music deepens your understanding of what music is, and how it works.</p><p>It allows you to share your musical ideas with the world, and better understand the works of others.</p><h3>The Process</h3><p>Below are the steps I take to create a piece of music. It starts with an idea, and ends with a written score that can be shared with and interpreted by others. Try it out and see what you come up with. I’m sure you’ll find what works best for you along the way.</p><h3><strong>1. Idea</strong></h3><p>Everything starts with an idea.</p><p>Do you have an idea for a piece of music? It can be about something, or nothing. Oftentimes, composers associate musical pieces with non-musical things, like the ocean (i.e.<strong><a title="Debussy's " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/debussy-la-mer-nocturnes-prelude/id50135041">Debussy’s<em>La Mer</em></a></strong>)</p><p>Think about music you have heard or know, and see if you can think of new, different music.</p><p>I bet there is already a song in your head. Now, you need to get it out of your head and into a usable form.</p><h3><strong>2. Research</strong></h3><p>In order to create the most interesting, appropriate, and unique piece you can, do some research. First, find out about the individual or group for whom you will be composing the music.</p><ul><li>What instrument(s) do they play?</li><li>At what level can they play them?</li></ul><p>If its for yourself, consider what you know how to do, or what you want to be able to do by creating and playing the piece.</p><p>Then, think about the style of music you intend to use.</p><p>Look for and listen to other music that sounds like what you want to create, or find music you think is cool and study it. Find out what makes it sound that way.</p><ul><li>What instruments does it use?</li><li>What rhythms does it use?</li><li>Is it one note or part at a time, or many notes and parts happening at the same time?</li><li>What note patterns does it use?</li><li>What chords does it use?</li></ul><h3><strong>3. Brainstorming</strong></h3><p>Once you have done research, and know enough about the performer(s) for whom you’re going to compose, spend some time brainstorming additional ideas.</p><p>Ask yourself questions like:</p><ul><li>What do I want to say with this piece?</li><li>What do I want to happen during the piece?</li><li>What is something innovative or interesting that I could do?</li><li>What will move people to tears, to anger, to joy, etc.?</li></ul><h3><strong>4. The Blueprint</strong></h3><p>After you have a bunch of ideas on paper (or in a notebook on my computer like<strong><a title="Evernote" href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a></strong>), you may find it helpful to create a blueprint for the piece.</p><p>This is just like the blueprint for a new building.</p><p>Music has structure, so you may want to create that structure before you do anything else.</p><p><strong><a title="Paul Hindemith" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a></strong>, a composer who taught at Yale in the early 20th century, said that the more detailed your plan for a piece, the more easily you can fill it out. Through experience, I agree.</p><p>Here are the things I consider when creating a blueprint for my music:</p><ol><li><strong>Length of Time</strong>– start here. How much time do you have?</li><li><strong>Movements</strong>– will the piece be a single movement or several movements. Decide now about how long you want each movement to be.</li><li><strong>Sections</strong>– after I figure out the larger structure,  I divide the piece, or movements, into smaller and smaller sections, depending on how much definition I want to give to the piece, or how long it is. A section can be just one theme, or where something particular happens, etc.</li><li><strong>Musical Ideas</strong>– once the piece is divided up into sections, I start filling in what I think should happen musically in each section. Will it be fugal, dance-like, slow? This almost always changes when I actually start writing music, but it gives me a good idea of the direction of the piece and will keep me from wandering aimlessly with the music.</li></ol><p>I usually start with a timeline (literally, a line on a piece of paper notated with the length of the piece) and find the “<strong><a title="The Golden Section" href="http://www.goldennumber.net/golden-section/">golden section</a>,</strong>” which is the geometric mean of the piece.</p><p>If you research either of those terms, you will find a wealth of information.</p><p>It has worked very well for me and many others, including Bartok, Debussy, the Greek architects, and many famous painters and sculptors throughout history.</p><p>An easy way to do this is to take the total time of the piece in seconds, and multiply it by 0.618. It’s about 2/3 of the way in, but this will give you the golden section of the piece. It can be a turning point in the progression of the music, the start of a new movement, or whatever you feel necessary.</p><h3><strong>5. Set up the score</strong></h3><p>After you have done your research and created a blueprint, you can set up the score in your music notation software (I use <strong><a title="Sibelius" href="http://www.sibelius.com/home/index_flash.html">Sibelius</a></strong>) and start composing. I use the blueprint to set up the sections of the music.</p><p>First, I decide on a tempo of the particular movement or section and then put double bar lines in at the divisions of sections I have determined. That way I know about how many measures I need to fill in each section, how many I have to get somewhere, or how many to achieve some big moment.</p><h3><strong>6. Improvise</strong></h3><p>After all the general ideas and technicalities are out of the way, I take some time to just play around on the piano. I experiment with different note combinations, chords, melodies, rhythms, etc.</p><p>Record yourself improvising, because you never know what you might be able to use later. Write  your best ideas down on paper, or enter them into your notation software. At this stage, I like to use pencil and paper.</p><h3><strong>7. Fill in the first draft.</strong></h3><p>Now that you have general music ideas and a structure to fill with them, start working through the piece. I generally start of the beginning, but I have also started in other places in the music because some harmonic progression or melody seemed to work best further into the piece.</p><p>You don’t have to do it all in order, but make sure you are aware of the flow of the piece.</p><h3><strong>8. Orchestrate and revise</strong></h3><p>After the first draft is complete, I step away from the piece for a day or two and then come back and make revisions, or to clean up the connections between ideas.</p><p>If you’re composing for a group, now is the time to make instrument choices, based on what you know about the group, and about the way instruments work together in general.</p><p>If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of orchestration, there are many great books on the subject.</p><p>I make any changes to the form, melody, harmonic progressions, or otherwise that I feel may need adjusting to work better within the context of the piece, or to help the flow of the music.</p><h3><strong>9. Pay attention to the details</strong></h3><p>I tend to pay attention to the details throughout the process, but after you have completed a second draft, it is time to comb through the score and look at all the little stuff.</p><p>Pay attention to things like dynamic markings, articulations, where words are placed, etc.</p><p>Making your score and parts look as great as possible is important for the people who will play your music. It will also make sure that you communicate, as best as possible, your intentions with the music.</p><p><strong><a title="Sibelius" href="http://www.sibelius.com/home/index_flash.html">Sibelius</a></strong> is very helpful in making music look great with minimal work.</p><h3><strong>10. Create the printed score and parts</strong></h3><p>This involves checking the score and parts one last time to make sure they are legible.</p><p>I usually export the score and parts to a PDF and then send them to the performer(s) or post them on my website for others to purchase or use.</p><h3><strong>Now it’s your turn</strong>…</h3><p>Anyone with some knowledge of music can create music. If you already play an instrument or sing, then start there.</p><p>Experiment with different combinations of notes and rhythms on your instrument or with your voice.</p><p>You become a composer the first time you create any music of your own, whether you write it down or not.</p><p>I would encourage you to write it down and share it.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to create.</p><p>Just do it.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="31"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="33"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="34"><span data-reactid="35"><!-- react-empty: 36 --><h2 data-reactid="37"><a data-reactid="38">dwaynerice</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="39"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="41"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="42"></div></section></div></div>
