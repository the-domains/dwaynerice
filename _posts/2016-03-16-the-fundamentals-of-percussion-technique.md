# The Fundamentals of Percussion Technique

"_Mother Nature and Gray's Anatomy are the forces influencing playing_."  
-- [Leigh Howard Stevens][0]

When I was at the University of North Texas working on my Masters in Music Performance, Leigh Howard Stevens taught a monthly masterclass on marimba technique one semester.

What I learned forever changed the way I think about not just marimba technique, but about percussion technique in general. It was a great experience.

Below is an outline of the main concepts of fundamental percussion technique, for anyone interested in playing or teaching percussion, based primarily on the lessons taught in the masterclass, and outlined in his book.

# Stroke

A stroke is defined as "a movement, especially one of a series, in which something moves out of its position and back into it."

In percussive terms, it is one complete movement that results in the production of a single sound from an instrument.

All strokes should be executed in the same manner (see The "Perfect" Stroke, below). The difference between strokes in a passage of music is where they end (recover to) vs. where they began. Below are four different stroke types associated with playing almost any percussion instrument, divided into two larger categories: (see[Basic Stroke Types][1])

1. **_Strokes that recover to their original starting height_**
  1. _Full Stroke_-- begin and end "high"  (+ +)
  2. _Tap_-- begin and end "low"  (- -)
2. **_Strokes that recover to a different height_**
  1. _Down Stroke_-- begin "high", end "low"  (+ -)
  2. _Up Stroke_-- begin "low", end "high"  (-  +)

### Three parts of a stroke:

1. **_Acceleration_**-- This is where you create the velocity (speed and direction) for the stroke. It should feel like throwing a baseball or dribbling a basketball.
2. **_Compressio_****_n_**-- This is the contact of the implement with the striking surface. It can be different depending on the implement's hardness or softness and the velocity of the stroke. You have the least amount of control over this part of the stroke._Note: This should not be confused with a dead stroke. _
3. **_Deceleration_**-- This part of the stroke is known as the**stroke recovery**or rebound. On a drumhead you feel the natural rebound. On a mallet instrument you must simulate the motion caused by a natural rebound.

### The "Perfect" Stroke

1. **_Take out all the Garbage_**. "Developing good technique is like taking out all the garbage." -- Joe Morello
  1. _Preparation in the stroke_-- separating the aim from the firing
  2. _Excess lift in the recovery_-- "Lifting out the note"
  3. _Wasted momentum_-- no unnecessary stops or changes of direction. " The mallets should not be moved anywhere that is not directly related to the task of striking the bars from the proper height and recovering to the proper height of the next note."
2. **_Acceleration and deceleration are distributed evenly over the stroke_**-- in Newton's law of motion, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. How fast you accelerate the implement toward the instrument should be how fast you decelerate on the rebound, regardless of recovery height.
3. **_"It should feel like your hand is following the stick, not like you are moving the stick."_**-- Gordon Stout

# Tone Production

### Properties

1. **Resonator**--  the part of an instrument that increases the volume of the sound produced by the vibrating surface through sympathetic vibration of an air mass.
  1. _On most mallet instruments_, the resonators are the tubes that hang under each bar. The size and shape of the air mass contained in the resonator will determine the length and strength (quality) of the ring produced. (Exception: Bells and Chimes, which function differently.
  2. _On percussion instruments with one to two drumheads_, the resonator is the body of the drum. The amount of amplification and effect on pitch and tone quality vary from instrument to instrument depending on their size, shape, number of drumheads, and tuning.
2. **Node**-- the point or region in a wave at which there is relatively little or no vibration. Every vibrating surface has at least one node. There are two nodes on most mallet instruments: the two places where the string goes through the bar. (exception: Bells and Chime). The node on any drumhead is the center.

### Where should I play?

[Gordon Stout][2]recommends playing in the following areas of the bar on a mallet instrument because the distance between any two notes will always be the same:

1. **Just above the center on the naturals**--for the clearest sound.
2. **On the edge of the accidentals** -- because this is the second best place to play on a bar and it is much closer to the naturals than above the string. This means exactly into the edge. One centimeter in toward the node makes a HUGE difference in sound quality -- and not a good one.
3. **In the highest octave**-- play in the center of all bars
4. **Consider Technical Demand vs. Desired Musical Effect**when deciding exactly where to play. Changes of tone between two notes is part of every instrument. Go for consistent volume from note to note and smooth crescendos and decrescendos. The performer can manipulate the tone color for effect -- play on the node, in the center, dead stroke, etc...

### Things that**_Do_**effect tone production

1. **Placement of implement**(stick or mallet)**in relation to the node(s)**
2. **Velocity of the stroke**-- speed or force, generally determined by height
3. **Angle of the stroke**-- direct or glancing blow. A glancing blow (slicing) changes the angle of the implement, therefore changing how much of its surface comes into contact with the instrument.
4. **Implement**-- mallet/stick choice: whether it is hard or soft, what it is covered with, how tightly it is wrapped, what the core is made of, the shape and constitution of the bead, etc.
5. **Condition of instrument**-- this part is not always within the player's control.  Concerns the type of drumheads used, the brand of instrument, the tuning, etc._Make the best of what you have or search for something better_.

### Things that**_Do Not_**effect tone production

1. **Winding **
2. **Pinching the stick**
3. **"Lifting out" the note**
4. **Anything not listed under**"Things That**_Do_**Affect Tone Production_"_

"_The drum doesn't care where you stop the stick or if you 'pull out' the sound._"  
-- Leigh Howard Stevens

# Important Concepts to Remember

_**All motion after contact with the instrument is in the service of the next stroke.**_This means that in the stroke recovery several things must take place, if necessary:

1. a change of height,
2. the move to the next note (shifting) or instrument, and/or
3. an interval change (when holding two mallets in one hand).

Sometimes all three are necessary to get to the next note properly.

**_To produce an accent_,**the stroke recovery height must be raised above the previous starting height to the new height for the volume of the accent._Remember to consider what happens after the accent as well. This will determine what type of stroke the accent should be. Most often it will be a downstroke (Accent/Tap)_

**_To change dynamic levels,_**the stroke recovery height would be raised for a higher dynamic level or stopped lower for a lower dynamic level._A crescendo or decrescendo is a gradual raising or lowering of the stroke recovery height._

**_Volume is determined by velocity_**(speed of the stroke).The velocity of every stroke should be proportionate to the**_starting height_**and the**_volume desired_**.  If you start too low for the volume, the stroke will look pinched and tense. If you start too high for the volume, it will look cushioned and restrained.

_**Strive for minimum motion and tension**_for the place and volume you want to hit a note by_choosing the lowest possible height_where you can preserve the smooth acceleration and deceleration of the mallet/stick.
