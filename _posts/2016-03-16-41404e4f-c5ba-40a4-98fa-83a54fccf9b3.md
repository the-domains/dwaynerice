My name is Dwayne. I live in Los Angeles, but grew up in Texas and have lived in NYC.

I've spent most of my life in music, as a student, performer, teacher, or composer. I've been moderately successful in each role, but its never been about success.

I currently work for [Green Dot Public Schools][0], a national "for purpose" charter school network, where I'm helping manage our digital assets, grow our supporter base, and increase our impact. We have 22 schools in three states, and are doing everything we can to help kids who need it the most graduate from high school and get into college.

This site is primarily about my work as a composer. Feel free to browse around and don't hesitate to let me know what you think. Intellectual conversation, constructive criticism, and appropriate compliments are always welcome.

Thanks for visiting, and I look forward to hearing from you!

~ Dwayne
